The gofStateMachine presentation was given to demonstrate how the state machine pattern is implemented in C++.  

* state_machine.dot : A dot file (text file) that defines a state machine.  
  The png is generated by the makefile using "make state_machine.png"
* lockbox.cpp : Implements a 'lockbox' which takes a secret and password and only displays the secret after the 
  unlock state machine has completed.  Each state represents a challenge to the user.
* Makefile : Used to build state_machine.png, lockbox and clean the directory.
